Large-Scale Entanglement on Physical Quantum Devices

This project is aimed to benchmark the capabilities of near-term NISQ quantum devices, the thesis focuses on characterising the entanglement of graph states prepared on those devices from various approaches. In this work, using a highly scalable method, we verified the generation of bipartite entanglements on all nearest-neighbour qubits from a record-breaking 414 graph state. We also studied the method of randomised stabilizers in fidelity estimation and demonstrate genuine multipartite entanglement of up to 14 qubits. We also develop a new tool of energy estimation for measuring entanglement and demonstrate in cases of up to 127 qubits. Furthermore, we achieve a doubling in coherence time of the graph state using entanglement preservation protocol. We also realize a sustaining of entanglement after at least 11 hops in teleportation.
